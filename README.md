- 👋 Hi, I’m @geowulf65
- 👀 I’m interested in signal processing. I've spent a lifetime dabbling in geophysical exploration methods - mostly seismic imaging techniques. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks to discover new ways to extract weak stationary stationary signals buried in humongously noisy data sets - keeping in mind that one man's noise is equally likely another man's signal.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
